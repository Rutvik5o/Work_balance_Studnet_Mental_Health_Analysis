## 📋 Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values (e.g., fill Financial Stress NaNs with the mean).  
- Correct data types for numerical analysis.  
- Transform categorical data into numerical formats (e.g., 'Sleep Duration').  
- Validate and standardize entries (e.g., city names, degree names).  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- SQL queries to explore patterns in academic pressure, CGPA, sleep, and diet.  

### 3. Insight Generation & Visualization
- Python analysis to create advanced metrics like **Composite Student Stress Score**.  
- Visualizations to uncover correlations, risk groups, and academic outcomes.

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Severe Sleep Deprivation ⏰** – Less than 5 hours of sleep strongly predicts depression.  
- **Financial Stress 💸** – Major driver of mental health issues; higher stress → higher probability of depression.  
- **High-Risk Group: Young Women 👩** – Female students, especially in Class 12, show higher depression and suicidal tendencies.  
- **Holistic Stress Score 📉** – Combining academic pressure, financial stress, and sleep deprivation shows that higher stress → lower CGPA.  
- **Healthy Habits Matter 🥗** – Better dietary habits correlate with higher study satisfaction and engagement.
